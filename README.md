# Vökvi

This is where I keep my QMK custom keyboard firmware; it's using the new [external userspace](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_external_userspace) feature and template repository, which is much nicer than maintaining a fork of [QMK](http://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/) itself.

This layout is the opinionated result of my own constant tweaking over the past couple of years. It's called Vökvi, which I understand translates roughly to "fluid".

## Design Principles

 - Optimise for expert use over learnability (hence, Colemak, and various other decisions below)
 - No finger (or thumb) should have to move more than one key in any direction
 - Uses a "3x6 + 3" layout - three rows and three thumb keys per hand.
 - Opposable thumbs are great. 
   - Left thumb's home position is tap for SPACE, hold for NUMERIC. 
   - Righ thumb's home position is tap for BACKSPACE, hold for SHIFT.
 - Home row mods are great. I've spent a lot of effort tuning them to work well.
 - Optimised for MacOS, with a gaming layer for Windows.
 - Optimised for English and polyglot programming.
 - Inspired by many other layouts: miryoku, callum, seniply, etc.
 - A moving target.
