# Vökvi

This is where I keep my QMK custom keyboard firmware; it's using the new [external userspace](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_external_userspace) feature and template repository, which is much nicer than maintaining a fork of [QMK](http://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/) itself.

This layout is the opinionated result of my own constant tweaking over the past couple of years.

It's called Vökvi, which I understand translates roughly to "fluid".

The layout is a Gallium variant.
